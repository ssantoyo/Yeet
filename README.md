## Overview
### Description
Yeet is a moblie application for iOS where users can search songs on Spotify and post reviews for all others to see. The purpose of this app is to allow users to get a sense of what others think about songs and for the user to share their own thoughts and opinions. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle/Entertainment
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would a good platform to have on a computer as well. Many people typically listen to music on the go, so having it mobile is more viable. 
- **Story:** Allows users to search for songs and create a review based on their thoughts of what they thought about the song.
- **Market:** Any Individual could choose to use this app, since this app will be open to all genres it will allow for a larger scope of people to use it. 
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often as the user likes, with it being a mobile app it can be used at any time and place. 
- **Scope:**  First the app would start off purely for song reviews, but would potentially evolve into a music streaming application to broaden the usage. Also, growing the scope past Spotify and adding Apple Music, Amazon Music, Pandora, etc.
